# StardewM1Mod

This project is a [Stardew Valley mod](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Getting_Started) that adds the **"MiniScript M-1 Home Computer"**.

This is a computer that connects to the TV in your cabin.  Despite its early-80s appearance, it actually runs a very modern and elegant language, [MiniScript](https://miniscript.org).
